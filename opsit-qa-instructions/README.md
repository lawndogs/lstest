# Instructions

## Things to do to prepare for the UBS interview
 - ensure that your machine has a Java JDK installed on it (we are assuming Java 8 will be used)
 - install an IDE of your choice to perform the interview (we have used Jet Brains IntelliJ IDEA)
 - included with this archive is an example project that is built using gradle, before the interview you should
   familiarise yourself with working on a Gradle project in the IDE of your choice.
 - when your environment is set up correctly running `gradlew check` from the command line should complete successfully.

## We value
 - simple, elegant code that reads like a narrative
 - thinking about the code more than the writing of the code (we spend a lot of time thinking/debating about what we are
   writing)
 - transparency and feedback to support continuous learning
 - excellent testing that acts as documentation
 - challenging boundaries where necessary
 
## Our vision of QA
 - creating a culture of quality in the team
 - participating in code reviews and pair programming with developers
 - breaking with traditional QA approach and mentoring team to introduce agile QA practices
 - helping the team to discover corner cases and test ideas
 - analysing development and release process to propose improvements
 - working with product owner on issues
 - eliminating waste including manual testing and excessive documentation
 - communicating with project stakeholders to prioritize work to be done
 - helping to deliver quality software, not just blocking poor software with defects from being released
 - being involved in requirement analysis and design of automated test cases
 - coaching developers to make them care about quality
 - challenging proposed business solutions
 - reviewing requirements in order to spot issues as soon as possible
 - creating and choosing right tools that will help the development team deliver things faster and with higher quality
 - applying test-driven development and behaviour-driven development in practice
 - exploratory testing

## What to expect from our process
 - we will not measure how long it takes to complete the exercise, but we expect it back in a reasonable period of time
 - we would like you to think of this as production ready code
 - we will review your solution and feedback to you our thoughts
 - we will additionally feedback to you whether we would like to take the process further
